## An API for the help finder project

The help finder project aims to provide mental health resources and locations to those in need. This specific project provides a API back-end to store therapists, and counselling centres near you. The API provides a public facing JSON endpoint in version 1. With version 1 a user can specify their postal code or zip as well as a distance in either kilometres or miles and the API will return a JSON package of the closest resources.
